# Beach-Cusps-SAR-Analysis
The code in this repo is designed to extract beach cusps profile from high resolution (sub-meter) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery as proposed by Adusei and Stark (in review).
The folder "SAR-Cusps-Analysis GITHUB" contains the following: (1) the python script (Cusps_SAR_Analysis.ipynb). Jupyter lab is required to open and run this script and (2) SAR image of the beach clipped to the area of interest (this was the image used for the analysis of Flagler Beach, see Adusei and Stark (in review)).

The image is provided to serve as an example for the user to easily follow the implementation of the code and adapt it to their dataset.
To apply the code to your dataset, it is important to follow the code cell by cell. What each code block does is explained in that specific cell.
