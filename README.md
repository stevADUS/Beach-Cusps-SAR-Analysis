# Beach-Cusps-SAR-Analysis
The code in this repo is designed to extract beach cusps profile from high resolution (sub-meter) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Imagery as proposed by Adusei and Stark (in review).
The folder "SAR-Cusps-Analysis GITHUB" contains the following: (1) the python script (Cusps_SAR_Analysis.ipynb). Jupyter lab is required to open and run this script and (2) SAR images of the beaches under study clipped to the area of interest (these were the image used for the analysis of Duck and Flagler Beaches, see Adusei and Stark (in review)). (3) The Digital Elevation  Models of the two sites.

The data is provided to serve as an example for the user to easily follow the implementation of the code and adapt it to their dataset.
To apply the code to your dataset, it is important to follow the code cell by cell. Instructions are oulined in each cell.
